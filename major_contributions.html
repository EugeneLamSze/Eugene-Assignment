        <article>
            <h2>James Watson</h2>
            <p>In 1953, Watson and Francis Crick discovered the double helix structure of DNA. When Watson served as the Director of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, he studied cancer research and his team was the first to identify cancer genes. He also served as the Director of the National Center for Genome Research, establishing the Human Genome Project and completing the genome map in 2007.</p>

            <h2>Frederick Banting</h2>
            <p>With the successful isolation of insulin, Banting began insulin treatment on diabetic patients. Bantingâ€™s interest in aviation medicine motivated his investigation on the problems of aviators, such as "blackout." He helped Wilbur Franks with the invention of the G-suit to prevent pilots from blacking out due to g-forces while turning or diving. Another of Banting's projects during WWII involved using and treating mustard gas burns.</p>

            <h2>Charles Kao Kuen</h2>
            <p>Kao proposed that fibres made of ultra-pure glass (SiO2) could transmit light for distances of kilometres without loss of signal. In 1970, the first fibre-optic cable was successfully produced. He proposed that such glass fibre could be used for long-distance information transfer, replacing copper wires that were traditionally used for telecommunication.</p>
